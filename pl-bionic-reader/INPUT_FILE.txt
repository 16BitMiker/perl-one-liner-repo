The sun was shining brightly as Alice walked down the path. She could hear the birds singing and felt the warm breeze on her face. In the distance, she saw a small house with a red roof. The garden was full of colorful flowers, and there was a little puppy playing near the fence. Alice waved her hand and smiled, feeling happy and content in the moment.
